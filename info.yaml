  how_it_works: |
      This design uses a 151-stage NAND-ring oscillator to drive a low drive strength inverter which has its signal combined with a
      high-drive strength inverter which uses the input of Harald Pretl's vDAC to saturate the output of a final high-drive strength
      output inverter.

      The effect this has is that it makes the duty-cycle of the output oscillator vary as the strength of the vDAC signal varies.
      From there, this signal is passed through a pair of flip-flops which are clocked by the TT system clock, creating a variable
      TRNG.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
